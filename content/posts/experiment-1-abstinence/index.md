## Introduction

This is the first in a series of experiments designed to understand the impact of mass information consumption on the human mind. Every day, I am exposed to an overwhelming stream of data: blogs, newsletters, YouTube deep dives, and social feeds. I have become acutely aware of my own **binge pattern**—a reflexive need to consume more and more, often at the expense of actually _understanding_.

This realization worries me. It is eroding my capacity to learn and my ability to focus. The infinite nature of digital data has created a "rushed" habit: I read a few sentences, skim the titles, and move on to the next item in a desperate pursuit of the "best" source. In reality, this works against me. It strips away my intellectual agency.

Looking back at history, the milestones that built our world—from the logical foundations of the Greeks to the breakthroughs of Newton and Einstein—were achieved in a pre-digital world. Their impact cannot be understated, yet they achieved greatness without changing browser tabs or clicking through infinite hyperlinks.

##  The Experiment: "Abstinence"

This first experiment, **Abstinence**, is about radical elimination. For the next **two weeks**, I am cutting out all non-essential information sources to reclaim my attention. I am limiting myself to a strictly curated set of inputs.

### ✅ My Curated Resources

For this period, I’m choosing to channel my time and energy into these specific resources:

- **Reading:** _A Promised Land_ by Barack Obama (Physical).
- **Technical Learning:** _Thinking Algorithmically_ by Daniel Zingaro (Strictly this single source).
- **AI Interaction:** **Gemini**. I may use the interface for queries and synthesis, but I am strictly prohibited from clicking external links or leaving the interface.
- **Creativity:** [Cartooning Club How To Draw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-biucJWhM8HwjsQ96uoIUw) (The only allowed YouTube channel).
- **Aviation:** [Navigraph Academy](https://academy.navigraph.com/) for Flight Simulation.
- **Entertainment:** Movies or shows are allowed, but **searching or "exploring" is prohibited.**  Effectively this limits me to programs I am already watching.
- **Movement:** 
	- AthleanX X-Press program
    - The Human Animal Method
    - My own daily mobility routine.
- **Gaming:** The "Daily Zip" challenge on LinkedIn.

### 🔇 Quietening the Noise

Everything else. This includes (but is not limited to) general YouTube browsing, LinkedIn feeds, Podcasts, HackerNews, BBC/news agencies, the TLDR newsletter, and MOOC platforms like Coursera.
### 🎢 Expected Outcome

I anticipate that the first few days will feel like **withdrawal**. I expect symptoms of digital addiction: restlessness, stress, and a temporary inability to focus because my brain is searching for its usual "dopamine hits."

However, I also expect a turning point. Eventually, I hope to feel a heightened ability to focus, a renewed enjoyment in slow problem-solving, and a general sense of mental peace.

### 📝 Reflections

I will maintain a written journal to track my daily reflections. After 14 days, I will publish a follow-up article detailing my findings and my next steps in this journey toward digital intentionality.
