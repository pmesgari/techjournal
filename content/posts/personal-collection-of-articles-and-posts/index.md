# Active Learning

As a an enthusiastic learner I come across a significant amount of blogs, articles, and other resources on a daily basis. I have realized skimming through these does not elevate my own knowledge and capabilities as much as I would like to. This passive learning and absorption of resources do not create the needed links in my mind so that I can apply what I gather and enjoy the benefits.

To break this pattern, I have decided to collect the most interesting blogs, articles, and videos that I have actually read and have given a serious attempt to understand. To cement my learning, I will also explain how I am planning to use what I have learned. Once I have applied the knowledge I will close the cycle with writing a review section and reflecting upon the experience.

I hope this will improve my active learning skills and allows me to get rid of all these open tabs and bookmarks across all my devices :)
##  The Code Review Pyramid by Gunnar Morling

The Pyramid illustration gives a clear and intuitive visualization of the code review process. Most questions are practical and will help improving code quality.

I am planning to use this as a guardrail for Claude when generating code. In combination with MCP tools to access internal company resources such as design standards and best practices Claude should have enough context to generate good quality code.
