## 👋 Hi, I'm Payam

💻 **Software Systems Engineer** | 🌍 Based in Amsterdam | 🛠 Cloudflare

With 8+ years of experience across **distributed systems**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **network automation**, I specialize in building **scalable**, **resilient**, and **automated** solutions that power global networks. At Cloudflare, I focus on eliminating operational toil through smart automation and robust system design.

I’m passionate about:

- Math and programming
- Algorithms and problem solving
- Designing fault-tolerant infrastructure
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Building tools that make engineering smoother and more intuitive

📓 On this blog, I share **hands-on tutorials**, **deep dives**, and **engineering insights** from the systems I build and the problems I enjoy solving.

🎄 During December, you’ll find me diving into puzzles over at [**Advent of Code**](https://github.com/pmesgari/adventofcodde), where I explore algorithmic challenges using Python.
