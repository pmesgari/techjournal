## The Problem

As an enthusiastic learner, I consume a significant number of blogs, articles, and white papers daily. But I’ve realized that skimming is not learning. Passive absorption doesn't create the neural links required to actually apply knowledge. It just leaves me with a brain full of noise and a browser full of open tabs.

## The Solution

To break this pattern, I am introducing a new section to Techjournal called Active Learning. Here, I collect the resources I have not just read, but analyzed.

## The Framework

For every resource listed here, I follow a three-step cycle:

### Input
What I read/watched and the core concepts.

### Application
A concrete plan on how I will implement this in my current projects or workflow.

### Reflection
A retrospective update on whether it actually worked.

This journal is my way of practicing clarity, cementing my own knowledge, and building a public repository of things that actually matter.
